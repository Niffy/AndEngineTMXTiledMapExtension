# AndEngineTMXTiledMapExtension

# Now based on GLES2-AnchorCenter,
Must use  [niffy-AnchorCenter branch](https://github.com/Niffy/AndEngine/tree/niffy-AnchorCenter "niffy-AnchorCenter branch")

##Broken features
Currently things such as drawing polylines or TMXObjects should be  broken, but should be easy to fix.  This is because AnchorCenter uses a slighty different coordinate system. This might get fixed in the future if I require the use of them.

##Thanks
[Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/ "Tiled")
Thanks to Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer , as parts of the isometric branch use code from the JAVA and Tiled 0.8.0(converted) When this has occured there should be a mention in the source code.  (Any problems regarding this please do contact me and we can fix it!)

### What it can do
 * Load isometric maps created in tiled
 * Tile offsets (Isometric layers only)
 * Get the tile at scene X and Y location from touch event
 * Get the tile at a given row and column
 * Set isometric draw methods (Yes 3 inefficent methods to choose from!)
 * Convert pixel coordinates to scene coordinates for Isometric maps
 * Set a map draw origin (NEW)
 * Use a TMXTileSetSourceManager to manage TileSet image sources
 * Set if we allocate TMX tiles(on TMXLayers), helps to save memory if you don't want the overhead.
 * Set the TMXLayer on creation to use a LowMemorySpriteBatchVertexBufferObject or a HighPerformanceSpriteBatchVertexBufferObject
 * Store the global tile id of each tile (Useful if not allocating tiles)

### How to use it
 * Exactly like you would before with the origin repo.
 * Use TSX tilesets (no idea if any other method works, I'm only interested in TSX tilesets)
 * When using an Isometric tileset with offsets in Tiled, the X offset has to be negative
 * To set the draw method call the TMXTiledMap method setIsometricDrawMethod
 * Set the map draw origin, in the load method. If you don't want one then use the values 0;
 * If loading multiple maps with the same tile set, then use a TMXTileSetSourceManager to reduce loading in the same image multiple times. You could probably even use this elsewhere!
 * To not allocate TMX Tiles use #setAllocateTiles(boolean pValue) on the TMXLoader
 * To use a LowMemorySpriteBatchVertexBufferObject call #setUseLowMemoryVBO(boolean pValue) on the TMXLoader
 * If not allocating TMXTiles then use #getRowColAtIsometric(float[] pTouch) to get the row and column tile. 
 * If not allocating TMXTiles to get the centre of the tile use #getIsoTileCentreAt(final int pTileColumn, final int pTileRow)
 * To store the tile global id, #setStoreGID(boolean pStoreGID) call on the TMXLoader. To get the id, on the TMXLayer call #getTileGlobalID(int pTileRow, int pTileColumn)
 
 ```java
TMXTiledMap txMap;
	try{
		txMap = tmxLoader.loadFromAsset(location,0,0);
		this.mMap = txMap;
		this.mMap.setIsometricDrawMethod(TMXIsometricConstants.DRAW_METHOD_ISOMETRIC_CULLING_PADDING);
		//Attach map
	}catch(final TMXLoadException tmxle){
		//catch error
	}
```

 * To get the TMXTile at a given location, as an example
 
 ```java
//Standard method of getting tile
	final float[] pToTiles = this.getEngine().getScene().convertLocalToSceneCoordinates(pX, pY);
	TMXLayer currentLayer = this.mMap.getTMXLayers().get(0);
	final TMXTile tmxSelected = this.currentLayer.getTMXTileAt(pToTiles[0], pToTiles[1]);
	if(tmxSelected != null){
		//Got a tile
	}
//Alternative way
	TMXTile TMXTileIsoAlt = this.mMap.getTMXLayers().get(0).getTMXTileAtIsometricAlternative(pToTiles);
		if(TMXTileIsoAlt != null){
			//got a tile
		}			
//Not allocating tiles
	int[] found = this.maps.get(0).getTMXLayers().get(0).getRowColAtIsometric(pToTiles);
	if(found != null){
		//Got location Row = found[0] Column = found[1]
	}
```

 * To get the centre of the tile
 
 ```java
	TMXTile pTile;
	float pX = pTile.getTileXIsoCentre();
	float pY = pTile.getTileYIsoCentre();
//not allocating tiles
	float[] centre = getIsoTileCentreAt(column, row);
	//centre[0] = X centre[1] = Y
```

###Features

- Tile Objects can be drawn on Isometric maps
- Polygons and Polylines points can now be converted to scene coordinates for isometric maps using a ConvertIsometricPixelToScene object
- Set a map draw origin, making it possible to have multiple maps in a scene. 
- Choose not to allocate TMXTiles(on TMXLayers) and set VBO to use, helps reduce memory usage if required.


### Notes
Be careful when designing layers, as having layers impacts on the performance negatively. So avoid large maps and many layers. 

Always try and test on multiple devices. I get respectable results on my HTC Desire S and poor results on my HTC Desire.  
As expected I get great results on my Nexus 7 Tablet, using a large map like Large_isometricblocks in my example, zoomed out scrolling 
I can get about 27-33fps then sitting at around 33fps.
